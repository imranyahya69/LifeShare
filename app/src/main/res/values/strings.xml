    <string name="aboutDetails">This application is built for helping the humanity by providing the blood services on
        time and by all possible means. In this application a private donor, a private NGO, a private blood bank and a
        government/private hospital will be providing blood for the needy people. This application will
        provide a website to the NGOs, blood banks, hospitals with a friendly user interface so that they can
        update blood availability with the time of blood transfusion. Donors will be provided the facility of updating their
        status after giving blood, which will make them idle for three months. This application will also accept charity
        from the ones who want to help our cause. This application will be available on android phones and web application
        will also be available for all devices. In future we will make an IOS application as well.</string>
